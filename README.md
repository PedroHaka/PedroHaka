- 👋 Hi, I’m @PedroHaka or simply Pedro Haka =)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Analysis and Development of the best product-software the market has to offer.
- 🌱 I’m currently attending graduate school in Systems Analysis/Development, at IFSP (Federal Intitute of Science and Tecnology), having started pursuing this degree 
at 2019 in my preparation studies to the High School National Exam, the passport to Federal Institutes all around Brazil. In 2020 I was accepted in São Paulo´s Federal Institute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving JAVA, HTML/CSS/JS, MySQL/MongoDB, pure logic and math content is also in pair to extend my knowledge of Software development. I attend to software engineering classes as well, and I had DataStructures, DataBases, Operational 
Systems,UML,among other topics, so my goal here at GitHub.com is to actively pursue and produce knowledge to best hone my skills as a software developer/analyst.
