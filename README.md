- 👋 Hi, I’m @PedroHaka or simply Pedro Haka =)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Analysis and Development of the best product-software the market has to offer.
- 🌱 I’m currently attending graduate school in Tecnology Analysis/Development, at IFSP (Federal Intitute of Science and Tecnology), having started pursuing this degree 
at 2019 in my preparation studies to the High School National Exam, the passport to Federal Institutes all around Brazil. In 2020 i was accepted in São Paulo´s Federal Institute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving C or JAVA, as these are the "base" languages i was introduced to, or even pure logic development as I do
not have any previous knowledge regarding datascience or software tecnologies. I do attend to software engineering classes, as well as Data Structures, Data Banks, Operational 
Systems, but I am having problems with languages and logic, especially Object oriented ones like JAVA, so my goal here at GitHub.com is to actively pursue and produce knowledge
in C and JAVA projects, to best hone my skills as a future professional.
